OpenSSL is an widely used open source library to perform cryptographic
operations. We can use it to encrypt, decrypt, digest, and sign data, 
as well as to make SSL/TLS secure connections through the Internet.

Let's [start with an example](openssl/rsa.md) to create a pair RSA keys, and use them to encrypt and decrypt data.
